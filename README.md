Jubil is an app for musicians to collaborate on songwriting, recording, mixing, and various other music-related activities. Each musician can add a track to any song they have heard or that they have written. All fees due to ASCAP or BMI will be appropriately managed. New songs being written will be clearly labeled, and their writers will designate whether they are intended for public use or private development.
